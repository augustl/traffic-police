# traffic-police

A generic Clojure path+method resource routing library. Can be used with Ring, or without.

## Example arbitrary usage

## Note: Not completely REST and/or hypermedia compliant

While this library is probably "more REST" than most other so called REST
libraries, we don't aim to completely implement the HTTP flowchart.
